# Harvard CS50 (2020) Audit Report

I, the owner of this GitHub account, conducted an audit of the Harvard CS50
(2020) course. During this audit, I completed several coding labs and problems using the available tools and infrastructure.

## Disclaimer

It is important to note that while all labs and problems were completed, they were not submitted formally. However, they were solved in accordance with the expected results. This material is not intended for use in any academic context, as not all problem sets were solved using Harvard's CS50 library, and some more efficient algorithms were not utilized.

Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
